MU Plugins Subdirectory Loader
============================

Enables the loading of plugins sitting in mu-plugins (as folders).

This plugin is an adaptation of the 'subdir-loader.php' script by Richard Tape and the
Centre for Teaching, Learning and Technology at the University of British Colombia.

To be consistent with other Blue Blaze plugins, we've set the author information in our fork of this
plugin to be Blue Blaze Associates.
